# Artificial Intelligence Data Assistant (AIDA)

AIDA is an experimental project that aims to implement an LLM based data assistant that is able to process user 
requests in natural language by interacting with a database. The assistant will generate an HTML widget that displays 
the results of the queries to the user in a web page.
